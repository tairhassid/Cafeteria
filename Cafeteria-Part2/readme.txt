This is a standalone system that mimics a cafeteria ordering system.
It was a project for my college cpp course.

First part: The idea behind the system and it's functionallity was raised by another team
and they wrote only the header files (.h files- only declarations).

Second part (this repository):
My partner and I corrected the header files to match what we've learned,
and implemented as cpp files.
The task was to avoid using STL (data structures, object functions and the class string)
and templates in this part.
